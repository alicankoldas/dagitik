This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled "The
Authoress of the Odyssey", which I published in 1897. I could not give
the whole "Odyssey" in that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore
epitomised my translation, which was already completed and which I now
publish in full.

I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just
mentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I
have there written. The points in question are:

(1) that the "Odyssey" was written entirely at, and drawn entirely
from, the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike
as regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of
Ulysses, when once he is within easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves
into a periplus of the island, practically from Trapani back to Trapani,
via the Lipari islands, the Straits of Messina, and the island of
Pantellaria.

(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived
at the place now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work
under the name of Nausicaa.

The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling
contentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English
and Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the
"Athenaeum" for January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were
urged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian "Eagle" for the Lent and
October terms of the same year. Nothing to which I should reply
has reached me from any quarter, and knowing how anxiously I have
endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument, I begin
to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I should have heard,
at any rate about some of them, before now. Without, therefore, for
a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce in my
conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me
as that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself
to translating the "Odyssey" for English readers, with such notes as
I think will be found useful. Among these I would especially call
attention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly
allowed me to make public.

I have repeated several of the illustrations used in "The Authoress of
the Odyssey", and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court
of Ulysses' house more vividly before the reader. I should like to
explain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is
accidental, and was not observed by me till I developed the negative. In
an appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the
plan of Ulysses' house, together with the plan itself. The reader is
recommended to study this plan with some attention.

In the preface to my translation of the "Iliad" I have given my views as
to the main principles by which a translator should be guided, and need
not repeat them here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of
translating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more
or less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in
poetry is wrong in prose, and the exigencies of readable prose are the
first things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,
however, may see how far I have departed from strict construe, I will
print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang's translation of the sixty lines or
so of the "Odyssey." Their translation runs:

  Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered
  far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of
  Troy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose
  mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his
  heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and the
  return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his
  company, though he desired it sore. For through the
  blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who
  devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from
  them their day of returning. Of these things, goddess,
  daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,
  declare thou even unto us.

  Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction,
  were at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but
  Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward
  path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her
  hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when
  now the year had come in the courses of the seasons,
  wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to
  Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even
  among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save
  Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus,
  till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now
  departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are
  sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where
  Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to
  receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he made merry
  sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in
  the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of
  men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his
  heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon,
  far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among
  the Immortals:

  'Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of
  us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves,
  through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows
  beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,
  beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife
  of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,
  and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had
  warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the
  slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor
  woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the
  hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate
  and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he
  prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good
  will; but now hath he paid one price for all.'

  And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: 'O
  father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that
  man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish
  likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for
  wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends
  this long while suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle,
  where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and
  therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the
  wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and
  himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky
  asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in
  sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is
  wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus
  yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from
  his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine
  heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not
  Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free
  offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore
  wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?'

The "Odyssey" (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the
"Iliad"; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with
marginal references to the "Iliad," and had marked them to this end in
my MS. I found, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly
scholasticised, and abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on
those who have the management of our University presses, that they would
render a great service to students if they would publish a Greek text of
the "Odyssey" with the Iliadic passages printed in a different type, and
with marginal references. I have given the British Museum a copy of the
"Odyssey" with the Iliadic passages underlined and referred to in MS.;
I have also given an "Iliad" marked with all the Odyssean passages, and
their references; but copies of both the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" so marked
ought to be within easy reach of all students.

Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen
round the "Iliad" since Wolf's time, without keeping it well before
his reader's mind that the "Odyssey" was demonstrably written from one
single neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to
this conclusion) presumably by one person only--that it was written
certainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.--that
the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the
"Iliad" as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose
genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to
be by Homer--any one who fails to keep these points before his readers,
is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who will
mark his "Iliad" and his "Odyssey" from the copies in the British Museum
above referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common
sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages in both
poems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their proper
value to a large number of books here and on the Continent that at
present enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps
is an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many puzzles of
the "Odyssey" cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they arise from
over-saturation with the "Iliad."

Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the
poem in the writer's mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some
length in pp. 251-261 of "The Authoress of the Odyssey". Briefly, the
"Odyssey" consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses,
which alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of the poem.
This poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of Ulysses'
adventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of lines
1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v., and thence without
intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at which point the
original scheme was abandoned.

(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of
Telemachus' voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly)
of Book i., is continued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till
Ulysses wakes in the middle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it
continues to the end of Book xxiv.

In "The Authoress of the Odyssey", I wrote:

   the introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix.,
   535, with the writing a new council of the gods at the
   beginning of Book v., to take the place of the one that was
   removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only things that were
   done to give even a semblance of unity to the old scheme
   and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse, after
   being asked to sing of one subject, spend two-thirds of her
   time in singing a very different one, with a climax for
   which no-one has asked her. For roughly the Return occupies
   eight Books, and Penelope and the Suitors sixteen.

I believe this to be substantially correct.

Lastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the
Leipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a
comma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the "Odyssey,"
that there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in so small a
matter; still, from a spirit of mere conservatism, I have preferred
to do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and viii., and
[Greek], at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial capitals in
an edition far too careful to admit a supposition of inadvertence, when
[Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii., and [Greek] at the
beginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I cannot determine.
No other Books of the "Odyssey" have initial capitals except the three
mentioned unless the first word of the Book is a proper name.

S. BUTLER.

July 25, 1900.




PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION

Butler's Translation of the "Odyssey" appeared originally in 1900, and
The Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition
of "The Authoress", which is published simultaneously with this new
edition of the Translation, I have given some account of the genesis of
the two books.

The size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both
books uniform with Butler's other works; and, fortunately, it has been
possible, by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into
each page, so that the references remain good, and, with the exception
of a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated
so far as they affect the Translation, the new editions are faithful
reprints of the original editions, with misprints and obvious errors
corrected--no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up
to date.

(a) The Index has been revised.

(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been necessary
to shorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been taken of
various corrections of and additions to the headlines and shoulder-notes
made by Butler in his own copies of the two books.

(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,
whereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the
page. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.

On page 153 of "The Authoress" Butler says: "No great poet would compare
his hero to a paunch full of blood and fat, cooking before the fire
(xx, 24-28)." This passage is not given in the abridged Story of the
"Odyssey" at the beginning of the book, but in the Translation it occurs
in these words:

"Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he
tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
of a hot fire, doing it first on one side then on the other, that he
may get it cooked as soon as possible; even so did he turn himself about
from side to side, thinking all the time how, single-handed as he
was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked
suitors."

It looks as though in the interval between the publication of "The
Authoress" (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his
mind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a
paunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man who
turns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one which a
great poet might make.

In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable
assistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,
Cambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,
Cambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the
care and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the
labour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and references
to the "Iliad" and "Odyssey," and I believe that it could not have been
better performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and it would have
been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known that his work was
being shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H. R. Robertson, who
more than half a century ago was a fellow-student with him at Cary's
School of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury.
